# Privacy Policy

We hate legalese, so we've tried to make this policy readable. If you've got any questions, feel free to [ask us](mailto:peterguanjun1992@gmail.com), and we'll do our best to answer.

We use information you share with us for our internal business purposes. We do not sell your information. This notice tells you what information we collect, how we use it, and steps we take to protect and secure it.

## 1. Information we collect

### 1.1 Non-Personal Data

Like most website operators, we collect Non-Personal Data such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

We collect this to understand how our visitors and members use our service, and use it to make decisions about how to change and adapt the service.

From time to time, we may release Non-Personal Data in aggregate form (for instance, by publishing trends in site usage) to explain our reasoning in making decisions. We will not release individual information, only aggregate information.

### 1.2 Personal Data

Personal Data is anything which can be used to identify or contact you, such as your legal name, email address, IP address, or physical location.

We don't collect any data from you.

## 2. Confidentiality and security

No data transmisson over the Internet can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You use this service at your own risk. However, we will take all reasonable steps (including appropriate technical and organisational measures) to protect your Personal Data.

Your account information is password-protected. We recommend that you choose a strong and secure password. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your password on our servers.

We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will take reasonable steps to notify you of any substantial changes to this Policy; however, it is your responsibility to check this Policy periodically for changes.
